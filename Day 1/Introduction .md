# What is Cloud?

To understand Cloud, let's take a step back 15 years. Back then, companies would buy servers from other companies and deploy a single application on one server. If they wanted to deploy another application, they needed to purchase another server. This approach led to:

- **Wastage of CPU storage**.
- High maintenance costs for servers.
- Risk of data loss in case of natural disasters.

To address these issues, the concept of **Virtualization** was introduced. For instance, if you were using a Windows machine and needed to work on a Linux machine, you could download a VM (Virtual Machine) box on your local Windows machine. However, this approach also had limitations, such as:

- **Limited storage** availability on your local machine.
- **Slower performance** of your local machine due to resource constraints.

This is where **Cloud Technology** comes into the picture. With a **Pay-as-you-go** pricing model, you only pay for what you use. Key benefits of Cloud include:

- No need to maintain servers.
- No large upfront investment in server infrastructure.
- High reliability and scalability.

Due to these advantages, Cloud technology has become highly popular in the last 5-7 years.

# Private Cloud vs Public Cloud

A **Private Cloud** is limited to companies only, where they manage and maintain their own cloud resources. However, startups and low-budget companies often lack access to such private cloud infrastructure due to high costs.

To address this, companies like **Amazon** and **Microsoft** introduced **Public Cloud** platforms. These platforms are affordable for startups and low-budget companies. Anyone in the world can create servers on Public Cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**, paying only for what they use.

### Key Features of Public Cloud
- **Scalable:** Easily adjust resources to meet demand.
- **Highly Available:** Ensures consistent performance and uptime.
- **Cost-Effective:** Affordable for companies of all sizes.

These features make Public Cloud platforms highly popular globally.

# Why AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a Public Cloud platform provided by **Amazon**. It is the most popular cloud platform among others because:

- **First Mover Advantage:** AWS was the first platform to introduce the concept of public cloud, giving it a significant head start.
- **Market Leadership:** AWS has a huge market share today.
- **Quick Cloud Support:** Offers reliable and prompt support.
- **Customizability:** AWS is more customizable than other cloud platforms.

### Key Features of AWS
- Over **200+ services** across various categories, including:
  - **Machine Learning (ML)**
  - **Database**
  - **Security**
  - **Networking**

These factors make AWS the leading choice for cloud solutions.
