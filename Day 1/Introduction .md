# What is Cloud?

To understand Cloud, let's take a step back 15 years. Back then, companies would buy servers from other companies and deploy a single application on one server. If they wanted to deploy another application, they needed to purchase another server. This approach led to:

- **Wastage of CPU storage**.
- High maintenance costs for servers.
- Risk of data loss in case of natural disasters.

To address these issues, the concept of **Virtualization** was introduced. For instance, if you were using a Windows machine and needed to work on a Linux machine, you could download a VM (Virtual Machine) box on your local Windows machine. However, this approach also had limitations, such as:

- **Limited storage** availability on your local machine.
- **Slower performance** of your local machine due to resource constraints.

This is where **Cloud Technology** comes into the picture. With a **Pay-as-you-go** pricing model, you only pay for what you use. Key benefits of Cloud include:

- No need to maintain servers.
- No large upfront investment in server infrastructure.
- High reliability and scalability.

Due to these advantages, Cloud technology has become highly popular in the last 5-7 years.
